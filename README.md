  # 📱 SWASHAKTI  App
AI-Powered Quality Check Application for Biodegradable Sanitary Pads
🟣 Overview

SWASHAKTI qc App is a mobile application designed to support women-led micro-enterprises in producing safe, hygienic, and BIS-standard (IS 5405:2019) compliant sanitary pads using AI-based visual inspection.

The app empowers women producers with simple, intuitive technology to ensure consistent quality without requiring technical expertise—enabling scalable, community-driven menstrual health solutions.

🎯 Problem Statement

In decentralized sanitary pad production units:

Quality varies across batches

Manual inspection is inconsistent

BIS compliance is hard to maintain

Producers lack technical QA tools

This results in reduced trust, health risks, and poor scalability.

✅ Solution

The SWASHAKTI QC App uses computer vision (AI) to:

Scan pads using a smartphone camera

Detect defects and inconsistencies

Generate instant quality scores

Provide actionable fix suggestions

Maintain digital batch records

This ensures standardized, safe, and reliable pads at scale.

🧩 Key Features
🔍 1. AI-Based Pad Scanning

Camera-based inspection

Detects:
